# Data-AI-Chatbot-Developer-with-Vanna.ai-Big-Query
To create a Data AI Chatbot using the Vanna.ai framework with Streamlit, integrating BigQuery as the data source, you'll need to follow a structured approach. I'll guide you through the steps for building this solution with an understanding of your specific requirements.
Overview of the Solution

    Vanna.ai Framework: You will use Vanna.ai (an AI framework) to create the chatbot's natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, handling complex queries related to your data.
    Streamlit: Streamlit will serve as the user interface, allowing users to interact with the chatbot.
    BigQuery Integration: BigQuery will store and process the data from Google Search Console and GA4. You'll need to query this data efficiently and link it to the chatbot.
    Query Cost Management: Implement mechanisms to avoid overloading BigQuery with expensive queries, optimizing performance.

Requirements

    Vanna.ai account and framework knowledge.
    Google Cloud BigQuery setup with access to Google Search Console and GA4 data.
    Streamlit for creating the user interface.
    Python for writing the logic.

Steps for Implementation
1. Install Required Libraries

You need to install the necessary libraries for Vanna.ai, BigQuery, and Streamlit. Use the following:

pip install vanna.ai google-cloud-bigquery streamlit pandas

2. Set Up Authentication for BigQuery

To access BigQuery, you'll need to authenticate using your Google Cloud credentials. Ensure you have the appropriate service account credentials set up.

Download the service account key JSON from Google Cloud Console and set the environment variable for authentication.

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/service-account-file.json"

3. BigQuery Integration for Data Querying

To query data from BigQuery, you'll first need to initialize a client, and then fetch data from Google Search Console and GA4.

from google.cloud import bigquery
import pandas as pd

# Initialize BigQuery Client
client = bigquery.Client()

# Define your BigQuery SQL query
query = """
    SELECT 
        page, clicks, impressions, average_position
    FROM 
        `your-project-id.your-dataset-id.search_console_data`
    WHERE 
        date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
"""

# Query BigQuery
df = client.query(query).to_dataframe()

# Display the fetched data
print(df.head())

4. Integrating Vanna.ai for Chatbot Creation

The Vanna.ai framework allows you to create and fine-tune a chatbot for your data. You will need to define intents, entities, and responses in the chatbot.

Hereâ€™s how you can set up the chatbot with Vanna.ai:

import vanna

# Initialize Vanna.ai model
chatbot = vanna.ChatBot("data_chatbot")

# Define intents (what users are trying to ask)
intents = [
    {
        "intent": "query_search_console_data",
        "examples": [
            "Show me clicks for my website in 2023",
            "What is my average position for search results?",
            "How many impressions did I get in January?"
        ],
        "response": "I will fetch the data for clicks, impressions, and positions."
    },
    {
        "intent": "query_ga4_data",
        "examples": [
            "What are the user sessions from GA4?",
            "Show me the bounce rate for my website"
        ],
        "response": "Fetching GA4 data for user sessions and bounce rate."
    }
]

# Add the intents to the chatbot
for intent in intents:
    chatbot.add_intent(intent['intent'], intent['examples'], intent['response'])

# Train the chatbot
chatbot.train()

# Now your chatbot is ready to respond to user queries

5. Building the Streamlit UI

The UI will let users interact with the chatbot. We'll use Streamlit to create a simple interface for the chatbot.

import streamlit as st

# Streamlit UI setup
st.title("Data Chatbot")

user_query = st.text_input("Ask the chatbot about your data:")

if user_query:
    # Process the user query through the chatbot
    response = chatbot.get_response(user_query)

    # Display chatbot response
    st.write("Chatbot: ", response)

    # Optionally, you can use the BigQuery client to fetch and display specific data based on the query
    if "clicks" in user_query.lower():
        query = """
            SELECT page, clicks FROM `your-project-id.your-dataset-id.search_console_data`
            WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
        """
        result_df = client.query(query).to_dataframe()
        st.dataframe(result_df)

6. Implementing Query Cost Management for BigQuery

BigQuery charges for the amount of data processed. To prevent high costs, you can:

    Limit Results: Make sure your queries fetch only the necessary data. Add LIMIT to your queries to restrict the amount of data returned.
    Pre-aggregate Data: Use summary tables in BigQuery to pre-aggregate data, so the chatbot can fetch summarized data rather than querying raw data.
    Caching: Cache results in memory (using libraries like joblib) to avoid redundant queries.

For example:

# Optimized Query with LIMIT
query = """
    SELECT page, clicks, impressions
    FROM `your-project-id.your-dataset-id.search_console_data`
    WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
    LIMIT 100
"""

# Execute the query
df = client.query(query).to_dataframe()

7. SOP for Training the Chatbot

Here's a simple Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for training the chatbot:

    Define Intents: Identify the key financial/business questions you want the chatbot to answer. These should include general questions related to Search Console and GA4.
    Collect Sample Queries: For each intent, collect a set of sample queries users might ask.
    Add Examples: In the add_intent() method, feed the chatbot these examples so it can recognize similar questions.
    Train: Use the train() method to train the chatbot. Re-train when adding new data or improving intent recognition.
    Deploy: Once training is complete, deploy the chatbot on your Streamlit application and integrate it with your BigQuery database.

Conclusion

This solution integrates Vanna.ai for chatbot functionality, BigQuery for data storage and querying, and Streamlit for the front-end UI. You will have a fully working data AI chatbot that fetches and interacts with BigQuery data in a meaningful way, while managing query costs effectively.

This is a starting point. As the system evolves, you can enhance it further by adding more sophisticated logic, integrating additional APIs, or enhancing the user interface for better interactions.
